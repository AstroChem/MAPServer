    <h1>MAPS Image Products</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the MAPS image products portal.</p>

    <h2>How to use this website</h2>
    <p>This website is designed to visualize the imaging products for every component of the MAPS dataset, by providing
        different views of the results based upon the criterion you are looking for. The easiest way to get started is
        to click around using the navigation bar above. You browse the available
        products by <a href={{ url_for('disks.disks') }}>disk</a> or <a
            href={{ url_for('disks.transitions') }}>transition</a>, and then drill down into the <a
            href={{ url_for('runs.runs') }}>results</a>
        from various imaging algorithms.</p>
